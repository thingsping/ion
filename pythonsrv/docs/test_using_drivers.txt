There are various drivers / stubs in the drvstubs directory. 
These are used to simulate IONMP compliant end points to work with our ion server 

ION server should be running on some machine (it could be the same machine as 
the test machine. )

=========================
1. createcredentials.py:
=========================
        
run python3 createcredentials.py. 

Will create credentials for input devices idev1 to idev8
and output devices odev1 to odev8. 
These credentials are directly inserted into the database. 


================================
2. testconstants.py
================================
Open the file test_registrations.py and change the value of 
    srv_addr="http://172.21.20.106:5000"

to 
    srv_addr=<your_servers_ip:port>

    run python test_registrations.py

    This will create registrations for the entities created using the previous
    createcredentials script. 
    This will also try to register with bad credentials and try to register
     entites which are not known to the server and cheks the test results
     prints a summary of the test results in the end.
