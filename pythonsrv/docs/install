# Installation and deployment 
#################

1. Install any 64 bit linux server. In our case, we have used ubuntu. If you want to setup using raspberry pi, then the normal rasbpian image will not work. MongoDb requires 64 bit and raspbian only has a 32 bit image. For this you will have to get a raspberry pi with a 64 bit image on it. 

2. Install the following packages: 

a) apt install python3-pip
a) pip3 install flask 
b) sudo apt install python3-flask
c) pip3 install requests
d) sudo apt install mongodb
d) pip3 install pymongo 
    on PI -  pip3 install pymongo==3.2
e) pip3 install pyrebase
f) pip3 install pyOpenSSL
g) pip3 install schedule 
h) pip3 install psutil
